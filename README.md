Battle Report DB AkA "Debriefer"

This tools allows users to log and share battle reports. It is first and foremost with Flames of War in mind, but should be viable for other war games. New features will allow this for sure! It will eventually be converted into a web app using ASP.NET.

Currently the only user profile with admin rights is user "Johan". All current users have password: "password". With admin rights you have access to a menu option where you can add new users.

Caution!
This is a very early version, that will throw runtime exceptions in some cases if the input is not valid. This will of course be fixed in the future!
