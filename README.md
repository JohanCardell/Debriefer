#Battle Report DB AkA "Debriefer"

This tools allows users to log and share battle reports. it is first and foremost with Flames of War in mind, but should be viable for other war games. New features will allow this for sure!

Currently the only user profile with admin rights is user "Johan". All current users have password: "password". With admin rights you have access to a menu option where you can add new users.

Entering the wrong kind of data or format when creating new forces, users or reports will cause the program to crash. This will be fixed in the future!
